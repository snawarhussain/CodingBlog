A personal blog where i'll be mostly writing about tech and programming. &nbsp;

> if a person asks your help in coding you lend them a hand, and if  two people ask; Then you blog about it.
><div style="text-align: right" ><b>-The unwritten rule of blogging </b> </div>  &nbsp;

This site is more of a brain dump for coding related issues that i encounter everyday and their solutions hoping it might help someone else.
