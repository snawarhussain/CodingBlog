There are a lot of tutorial out there about setting up django with mod_wsgi and apache. however most of them are outdated or incompete. none of them tell how to exactly configure the whole set up
when i tried to configure django with apache i had to read a lot of documentation and look through lot for forumns to piece together all the information. therefore, i decided to make this tutorial for the latest apache2 and django 3.2.5.

we gonna walkthrough each step in the procedure in a systematic way setting up the whole thing and this tutorial includes serving the admin panel files from django with apache2 as well.

# installing apache2

install apache2 and apache2-dev package with `apt-get`
```s
sudo apt-get apache2 apache2-dev
```
now just to make sure apache2 is installed correctly and it's service is running with
```s
sudo systemctl status apache2
```
you will get something like this...

![apache_status](/assets/images/django_blog_images/apache_status.png)

if the service is not running you can start it with
```s
sudo systemctl start apache2
```

now if the apache2 service is running we can go to the local host `https://127.0.0.1` it will show the default apache2 page with a prompt `It works!`. we have apache2 installed now

next step is to install django3 
# installing Django3.2.5
for that it is highly recommended to use that we use a python virtual environment. refer to the python virtual environment post if you need any help 
make a virtual environment for django with conda or virtual_env
with conda:
```s
conda create --name django3 python=3.8
```
then activate the environment 
and install django with either conda or pip
during the time of the post `django3.2.5` isn't available on conda channels so i installed it with pip (pip is another package manager like conda)
```s
pip install django==3.2.5
```
you can do type `django-admin version` to check to confirm django's installation.

## making a simple django app


make a new django project in  `home` directory `~/`  using:
```s
django-admin startproject mysite
```
**Notice:** It is important that you start the new project in home directy rather than some directory in root i.e. `/var/www/` because django-admin need to read-write access. you might run in to error if you try to start a project in `var/www/`. or you can give the read write from `root` to another user like yourself or `www-data : www-data`  in apache2 case with command `sudo chown -R group:user`
{: .notice--info} 

if you see list the directories,  there's gonna be  a new dir called `mysite`
the structure of a django project looks like this
```js
mysite/
    manage.py
    mysite/
        __init__.py
        settings.py
        urls.py
        asgi.py
        wsgi.p
```

make migrations for database
```s
python manage.py makemigrations
```
and migrate
```s
python manage.py migrate
```

create a superuser to access the admin panel of django and go through the generic prompts
```zsh
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
now you can start django's built-in server to see if everthing's working fine
```s
python manage.py runserver
```
and go to the default `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` and you'll get the **install worked succesfully** page.

you can access the admin panel by appending `admin/` to the rest of the url like `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin` and login with the username and password you created.

![django admin](/assets/images/django_blog_images/django_admin.png)


press Ctrl+C to stop the server from terminal

now we want apache to server  the same page with admin panel included using mod_wsgi
# install mod_wsgi

for installation of the mod_wsgi we will follow this [documentation](https://pypi.org/project/mod-wsgi/)



install the mod_wsgi with pip 

```s
pip install mod_wsgi
```
now to check the installation of mod_wsgi use
```s
mod_wsgi-express start-server
```
and go to the `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` it will show you the mod_wsgi whiskey page (idk why though).

now to use mod_wsgi with django we need to add mod_wsgi into INSTALLED APPLICATIONS.

open the settings.py with any editor like vim in terminal from `home/mysite` (`~/mysite`) directory 
```s
sudo vim mysite/settings.py 
```
and add the `mod_wsgi.server` at the end of INSTALLED_APPS and save the file.

![settings.py](/assets/images/django_blog_images/settings.py.png)


now run django with apache and mod_wsgi with 

```s
python manage.py runmodwsgi
```
it will show you something like this in terminal:

and if you go the `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` you will see that same django welcome page but this time its being served with apache2 and mod_wsgi 
if we go to the admin panel of the site with url `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` you will see that there is no styling because we are missing static files for it. we need to add static_root directory and then collect static
open `setting.py` again 
```s
sudo vim mysite/settings.py
```
and search for line  `STATIC_URL = '/static/'`
and underneath it add this line:
```s
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static')
```

![django welcome](/assets/images/django_blog_images/static_root.png)




***NOTE:*** make sure to `import os` in the beginning of settings.py if its already not imported
{: .notice--info} 

close the file and run
```s
python manage.py collectstatic
```
to collect the static files in the static folder of the root directory of the project. 
and then run server again with 
```s
python manage.py runmodwsgi
```
and this time if you go to the admin panel of the site you should be able to see the stayling applied.
